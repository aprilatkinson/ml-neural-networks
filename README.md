# ML Neural Networks – Image & Audio Classification

This repository contains my work for ** Build Simple Neural Network**, completed as part of the AI Engineering curriculum.

The lab is divided into two parts:
1. Building a neural network **from scratch** for image classification (Dogs vs Cats)
2. Exploring **pre-trained transformer models** for audio classification

## Business Application Example

This project demonstrates the technical foundation behind many AI-driven
marketing use cases:

- Automated product categorization in e-commerce catalogs
- Creative asset classification for performance optimization
- Content moderation and brand safety filtering
- Audience segmentation signals for campaign optimization

In enterprise environments, models like this sit behind governance layers
ensuring explainability, data quality, and controlled deployment.
